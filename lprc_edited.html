                    <br>
                    <p>The Loss Prevention Resource Council wanted us to come up with a solution to
                        prevent losses related to self-checkout, all while enhancing the user experience.
                        Losses are either intentional or unintentional. Intentional losses occur when an
                        individual intends to steal an item. <br><br>
                        • For example, if an individual scans a cheap shirt
                        and slides an expensive shirt underneath it, that would be an intentional loss.<br><br>
                        • However, an unintentional loss occurs when an individual forgets to scan water
                        bottles at the bottom of their cart.

                    <h4><b>Proposal</b></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>My team proposes implementing A.I. vision technology on self-checkout
                        (SCO) units based on the following problems: <br>
                        • Self-checkout units, since first introduced, have lead to an increased
                        intentional
                        and unintentional loss in retail stores. <br>
                        • Users of self-checkout units find it to be an inconvenience and not as
                        easy an
                        experience as traditional cashiers.<br><br>

                        The A.I. vision technology along with other interface designs will address
                        these
                        problems through the following goals: <br>
                        • Create an interface that users with low technology literacy find
                        intuitive.
                        <br>
                        • Introduce technology that will assist shoppers with their self-checkout
                        process.
                        <br>
                        • Introduce technology that will help stores with unintentional loss and
                        make
                        users
                        of the system feel safer.

                    <h4>User Research</h4>
                    <Br>
                    <p>In order to keep our interviews focused towards the focus statement, we
                        created a list of interview goals. These goals will guide us in our interviews to
                        ensure we gather the data we need. <br><br>
                        • Learn when, how and why customers are creating unintentional losses. <br>
                        • Gather any issues that customers have with the current functionalities of
                        self-checkout terminals, specifically with the scanning/entering of
                        merchandise. <br>
                        • Understand how the environment around the self-checkout terminals affect
                        the user experience of the customers. <br>
                        • Learn why customers may prefer a personal cashier and what attributes from
                        their experiences with cashiers can be transferred over to self-checkout
                        terminals.

                    <h4>Interviews</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>In regards to recruiting users to interview, we are targeting people that
                        shop at stores that provide self-checkout terminals. These include, Walmart
                        and Home Depot. Due to time and other limitations, we were not able to
                        physically go to the stores to conduct the interview. Therefore, we reached
                        out to students and other individuals, who do shop at those stores on a
                        normal basis. The client did indicate in the project brief that we could use UF
                        students as our user base. <br><br>
                        • In addition to conducting our own interviews, the client has indicated that
                        they have pre-existing data from their own user research. This data should
                        cover aspects of user research related to intentional losses, as it has interviews
                        with convicted shoplifters. Further, it could help us broaden our audience
                        to be more inclusive of all types of shoppers.

                    <h4>User Needs</h4><br>
                    <p>From our interviews and affinity diagramming we discovered three key user
                        needs. Users mentioned they were persuaded by short lines and fastness, hence user
                        need 1.<br><br>
                        Another key theme we found was that users were frustrated with the manual
                        input process revolving around self-checkout, which resulted in user need 2.
                        <br><br>
                        1) The user needs a faster way to use self-checkout, specifically when it
                        comes to non-barcoded goods. <br>
                        2) The user needs to be guided throughout the process of manually inputting
                        items.<br>
                        3) The user needs to be held accountable for items they have not rung up
                        yet.
