                        of outside factors that can contribute to students preferring to make non-healthy eating
                        choices, as well as being influenced on a social level and their physical environment.

                            Although it was a tiring weekend, I thought it was actually really fun. Emily presented the
                            idea and I thought that it may be really helpful to college students transitioning from
                            high school or just trying to become healthy.<br><br>

                            <b style="color: #6BBCC0;">Communication is important!</b><br>
                            I believe what made our project so successful was Emily and I's communication. After every
                            task, we often updated eachother and made sure we were on the same page. We did not have a
                            lot of misunderstandings - even if we did it was clarified quickly.<br><br>

                            <b style="color: #6BBCC0;">Determine the value of the app</b><br>
                            The part that took up most of the time was determining what should and should not be in our
                            app. From our research and surveys, we found many problems and lots of possible solutions.
                            We had to narrow down to the most important and what really mattered for our target users.

                            <b style="color: #6BBCC0;">Test!</b><br>
                            Unfortunately because there was a limit in time, we could not conduct usability tests as we
                            had hoped. If we conducted some testing, we would know what works and does not work in terms
                            of UI design and usability.

                        <p>Emily and I would love to expand this project in the future and conduct tests to our target
                            users! </p>
