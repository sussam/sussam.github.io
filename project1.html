                            <h5>Problem</h5>
                            <p>The Loss Prevention Resource Council wanted us to come up with a solution to
                                prevent
                                losses related to self-checkout, all while enhancing the user experience. Losses
                                are
                                either intentional or unintentional. Intentional losses occur when an individual
                                intends to steal an item. For example, if an individual scans a cheap shirt and
                                slides an expensive shirt underneath it, that would be an intentional loss.
                                However,
                                an unintentional loss occurs when an individual forgets to scan water bottles at
                                the
                                bottom of their cart.</p>

                            <div class="anchor" id="sec1b"></div>
                            <h5>Proposal</h5>
                            <p>My team proposes implementing A.I. vision technology on self-checkout
                                (SCO) units based on the following problems: <br>
                                ● Self-checkout units, since first introduced, have lead to an increased intentional
                                and unintentional loss in retail stores. <br>
                                ● Users of self-checkout units find it to be an inconvenience and not as easy an
                                experience as traditional cashiers.<br>

                                The A.I. vision technology along with other interface designs will address these
                                problems through the following goals: <br>
                                ● Create an interface that users with low technology literacy find intuitive. <br>
                                ● Introduce technology that will assist shoppers with their self-checkout process.
                                <br>
                                ● Introduce technology that will help stores with unintentional loss and make users
                                of the system feel safer.
                            </p>

                                unintentional misuse.</p>

                            <h6>Interview Goals</h6>
                            <p>In order to keep our interviews focused towards the focus statement, we created
                                a list of interview goals. These goals will guide us in our interviews to ensure
                                we gather the data we need. <br>
                                ● Learn when, how and why customers are creating unintentional losses. <br>
                                ● Gather any issues that customers have with the current functionalities of
                                self-checkout terminals, specifically with the scanning/entering of merchandise.
                                <br>
                                ● Understand how the environment around the self-checkout terminals affect the
                                user
                                experience of the customers. <br>
                                ● Learn why customers may prefer a personal cashier and what attributes from
                                their
                                experiences with cashiers can be transferred over to self-checkout terminals.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Recruitment & Conducting Interviews</h6>
                            <p>In regards to recruiting users to interview, we are targeting people that
                                shop at stores that provide self-checkout terminals. These include, Walmart
                                and Home Depot. Due to time and other limitations, we were not able to
                                physically go to the stores to conduct the interview. Therefore, we reached
                                out to students and other individuals, who do shop at those stores on a normal
                                basis. The client did indicate in the project brief that we could use UF
                                students as our user base. <br>
                                The three of us conducted the interviews in a similar manner to the ones we
                                conducted for project one. We found it essential to have one person solely
                                dedicated to taking notes and another giving the interview. We wanted the
                                interview to be unintimidating, and in-depth to truly capture the users’
                                experience with self-checkout. Therefore, we believed one-on-one interviews were
                                more beneficial than focus groups. <br>
                                In addition to conducting our own interviews, the client has indicated that
                                they have pre-existing data from their own user research. This data should cover
                                aspects of user research related to intentional losses, as it has interviews
                                with convicted shoplifters. Further, it could help us broaden our audience to be
                                more inclusive of all types of shoppers.

                            <h5>User Needs</h5>
                            <p>From our interviews and affinity diagramming we discovered three key user needs.
                                Users mentioned they were persuaded by short lines and fastness, hence user need
                                1. Another key theme we found was that users were frustrated with the manual input
                                process revolving around self-checkout, which resulted in user need 2. Finally,
                                a third prominent theme we discovered was
                                <br>
                                1. The user needs a faster way to use self-checkout, specifically when it comes
                                to non-barcoded goods. <br>
                                2. The user needs to be guided throughout the process of manually inputting
                                items.
                                <br>
                                3. The user needs to be held accountable for items they have not rung up yet.

                                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                                Ipsum
                                has
                                been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                                printer
                                took a
                                galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
                                not
                                only
                                five
                                centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                                unchanged.
                                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                                Lorem
                                Ipsum
                                passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                                PageMaker
                                including
                                versions of Lorem Ipsum.
