                    <br>
                    <p>• Artificial Intelligence (AI) is use widely throughout a variety of platforms.
                        However, the decisions and
                        actions taken by AI are not generally transparent to end users. If users do
                        not understand the way of machine learning techniques, they often distrust
                        the information.
                        <br><br>
                        • Additionally, AI system owner's may output and manipulate
                        information without users knowing. People who have little to no
                        understanding of
                        AI will become consumers of this manipulated information without knowing
                        what is happening regarding changed information.
                        <br><br>
                        • Because the output is
                        disregarded by the user, this
                        generally reduces the effectiveness of the AI system.

                    <br>
                    <p>• The study was designed to evaluate which two different methods of AI
                        education delivery to understand which is most effective for building
                        awareness and understanding AI.
                        <br><br>
                        • The two methods studied were contextualized
                        and non-contextualized (whether learning in-situ is effective).
                        <br><br>
                        • In order to
                        deliver contextualized content, our group planned to create pop-up GIFs with
                        graphics and explanatory text. For the non-contextualized content, it was
                        decided to have a separate website participants would refer to when
                        performing the
                        tasks.

                    <p>The goal of the interviews were to understand how much AI potential users may
                        know about AI and which AI learning topics they would be interested in
                        The questions included: <br><br>
                        1) How much do end users already know about AI? <br>
                        2) Which parts of the
                        websites (social media and shopping) would users be most interested in
                        learning more about? <br>
                        3) What website / artificial intelligence related
                        topics are users curious about?

                    <br>
                    <p>We conducted six interviews with potential users.
                        The
                        interviewees had varying degrees of experience with artificial intelligence.
                        Many were unfamiliar with AI but have only heard of the concept. A summary from these
                        interviews: <br><br>
                        • Most heard of AI, but doesn't know much about Machine Learning<br>
                        • Facebook uses AI in features such as ads, news feed, suggested friends<br>
                        • AI may be used on every feature on Amazon, including recommended items, deals of the day, and
                        recent searches.

                    <h4>Personas</h4><br>
                    <p>When analyzing the notes from the interviews, we found that the majority has
                        heard of AI but does not know much of it. Some recognized that sites like
                        Amazon and Facebook use AI in features such as recently viewed,
                        recommendations, and recent purchases.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Because not a lot of the interviewees only knew about a few features, one
                        user need that we really focused on was being able to navigate through the
                        website easily while learning about each feature that used AI.

                        <br>
                        Thus, the two personas were developed for the study. Both personas were
                        created
                        to be
                        similar, having almost identical interests and daily lives. </p>

                    <p>Here, we're brainstorming how to display the pop-ups that will appear
                        when the user hovers over an AI feature.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our team decided to go with pop-ups beacuse when the user hovers
                        over a feature such as tagged photos, it is easy to see that it uses
                        AI versus a feature such as profile picture that doesn't use AI.

                    <h4>Challenge</h4><br>
                    <p>When researching about how people learn best, we found through credible
                        sources
                        that children learn best when a minigame or pictures are included. However,
                        after analyzing and working through the game, we found that it may require
                        users
                        to stay on the same pop-up, even if they didn't want to learn about that
                        specific AI.
                        <br>
                        Because of this, we decided to go with a simple gif to explain the AI to
                        users,
                        while allowing them to approach other features easily.

                        both
                        AI and non-AI features were kept in mind.

                    <p>Finally, I was able to fully implement the popups GIFS as planned
                        into a
                        website. This is how the finalized website looked like to users.
                        When hovering over all the AI features mentioned above, a popup
                        with
                        a GIF will be displayed.

                    <h4>Project Learnings & Reflection</h4><br>
                    <p>After providing another survey questioning users on specific AI features, we
                        found that there was no significant difference in the level of AI learning
                        that occurred between the contextualized and non-contextualized methods if
                        AI Lessons delivery.

                        <br>
                        • Our biggest challenge was the pop-ups and deciding what we would
                        implement to make the users feel they are enjoy learning. <br><br>
                        • Initially, we
                        decided that providing a game such as true or false would be beneficial,
                        however, this would have made the user to stay on the same pop-up for quite
                        a long time. <br><br>
                        • After dwelling on this, we went with another method that may
                        have been better than doing a true/false game. <br><br>
                        • In the end, I learned that
                        criticism shouldn't be taken to heart, instead should be used to reflect and
                        consider another possible solution.
